DHAR allows plants to recycle oxidized AsA before it is lost. AsA serves as a cofactor of violaxanthin de-epoxidase in the xanthophyll cycle and as an antioxidant in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species. Because AsA is the major reductant in plants, DHAR serves to regulate their redox state. It has been suggested that a significant portion of DHAR activity is plastidic, acting to reduce the large amounts of ascorbate oxidized during hydrogen peroxide scavenging by ascorbate peroxidase.

In addition, GSTs also show GSH peroxidase activity and are involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. This family, also referred to as soluble GSTs, is the largest family of GSH transferases and is only distantly related to the mitochondrial GSTs (GSTK subfamily, a member of the DsbA family). Soluble GSTs bear no structural similarity to microsomal GSTs (MAPEG family) and display additional activities unique to their group, such as catalyzing thiolysis, reduction  and isomerization of certain compounds. The GST fold contains an N-terminal TRX-fold domain and a C-terminal alpha helical domain, with an active site located in a cleft between the two domains. Based on sequence similarity, different classes of GSTs have been identified, which display varying tissue distribution, substrate specificities and additional specific activities. In humans, GSTs display polymorphisms which may influence individual susceptibility to diseases such as cancer, arthritis, allergy and sclerosis.

In addition to its role in protein biosynthesis, EF1Bgamma may also display other functions. The recombinant rice protein has been shown to possess GSH conjugating activity.

A transmissible conformational change of Ure2p results in a prion called [Ure3], an inactive, self-propagating and infectious amyloid. Ure2p displays a GST fold containing an N-terminal TRX-fold domain and a C-terminal alpha helical domain, with an active site located in a cleft between the two domains. The N-terminal TRX-fold domain is sufficient to induce the [Ure3] phenotype and is also called the prion domain of Ure2p. In addition to its role in nitrogen regulation, Ure2p confers protection to cells against heavy metal ion and oxidant toxicity, and shows glutathione (GSH) peroxidase activity. Characterized GSTs in this subfamily include Aspergillus fumigatus GSTs 1 and 2, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe GST-I. GSTs are cytosolic dimeric proteins involved in cellular detoxification by catalyzing the conjugation of GSH with a wide range of endogenous and xenobiotic alkylating agents, including carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins and products of oxidative stress. GSTs also show GSH peroxidase activity and are involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.",1.A.12

S. cerevisiae ECM4 mutants show increased amounts of the cell wall hexose, N-acetylglucosamine.

It is expressed at high levels in hair cell stereocilia and is associated with the actin cytoskeleton and ezrin.
